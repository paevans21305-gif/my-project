<u> <h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:Brush Script MT;"> WELCOME TO FIFTH FORM </h1> </u>
<u><h3 style="font-family:times new roman;"> <b>THE CXC PROGRAMME</b> </h3> </u>
<p style="font-size:18px"> The Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examination is offered in January for re-sit and private candidates and in May/June for in-school candidates and private candidates.
<br>
CSEC subjects are examined for certification at the General and Technical Proficiencies. The General and Technical Proficiencies provide students with the foundation for further studies and entry to the workplace.
The Council now offers a total of 33 subjects, that is, 28 subjects at General Proficiency and 5 at Technical Proficiency.
<br>
The six-point grading scheme reports on the performance of the candidate under six overall and profile grades as follows:
<ul>
<li>Overall grades – I, II, III, IV, V, VI</li>

<li>Profile grades – A, B, C, D, E, F</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:18px">
<b> The Council has advised tertiary institutions and Ministries of Education in participating territories that Grades I – III at the General and Technical Proficiencies should be considered as satisfying the matriculation requirement for four-year programmes at universities and entry requirement to community colleges, teachers’ colleges and any tertiary institution offering post-secondary programmes.<b>
